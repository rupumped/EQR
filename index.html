			<h2>Our Mission</h2>
			<div class="subcontainer">
				<div class="text">
					<h3>If you've been in an accident that renders you unresponsive, EQR communicates your vital medical information to emergency responders.</h3>
					<p>It's important to keep certain medical information readily available in case of emergencies. The worst-case scenario of an emergency ambulance response is that the crew knows nothing about the patient. If the patient is unresponsive, emergency responders can only try their best to treat life-threatening signs and symptoms. In an emergency, information can make the difference between life and death.</p>
					<p>People with allergies or medical conditions that affect emergency medical response need to keep information about their condition easily accessible. Some keep <a rel="external" href="http://www.lifeseniorservices.org/images/seniorline/EmergencyMedicalForm.pdf" target="_blank">emergency medical information forms like this one</a>, but lengthy paper forms are a hassle to keep accessible when you leave your home. Patients can <a rel="external" href="https://universalmedicaldata.com/emergency-medical-card/" target="_blank">fit some forms into a wallet</a>, but the cards need to come in packs to contain all of the necessary information and are filled with miniscule font. Others wear <a rel="external" href="https://www.laurenshope.com/" target="_blank">medical ID jewelry like these</a>, but jewelry is expensive and often lacks enough space for everything emergency responders need. There is currently no good solution to communicate all of an unconscious patient's relevant medical information to emergency responders.</p>
					<p>EQR solves this problem. <a rel="external" href="https://www.americanmedical-id.com/faq" target="_blank">More than 95 percent of respondents look for a medical ID during emergencies.</a> By encoding all of your medical information into a compact QR code, EQR empowers patients to communicate vital medical information to emergency responders even while unconscious. When checking a patient for ID, responders can easily scan a patient's EQR code with a smartphone and have immediate access to all relevant information. EQR codes can be placed on a single wallet card with room to spare, attached to a child's backpack, or set as a smartphone lock screen.</p>
					<p>EQR codes are 100% secure. Unlike <a rel="external" href="https://myhealth.alberta.ca/myhealthrecords" target="_blank">other medical records services</a> <a rel="external" href="http://www.sos-qr.com/" target="_blank">and apps</a>, EQR does not store your information on any server. Instead, EQR leverages physical layer security, encoding all of the information you enter into the EQR code itself. The only way to access your medical information is to scan the EQR.</p>

			<h2>History</h2>
			<div class="subcontainer">
				<div class="text">
					<h3>EQR, or Emergency QR, began as a fun coding project between brothers.</h3>
					<p>Dr. Nicholas Selby is a robotics engineer. His other public health ventures include a room-disinfecting robot and an aerial mapping system for urban environments.</p>
					<p>Lucas Selby is an undergraduate creative writing major at Arizona State University (ASU). While most of his work comes from writing and editing content for various magazines and organizations, he loves to code. His favorite computer languages are C++, HTML, and CSS.</p>
					<p>Nicholas began by employing his skills in Javascript to develop a QR code capable of storing the equivalent of dozens of pages of medical information with physical layer encoding, reaching out to his contacts in the medical field for the information emergency responders need in case of an accident. From there, he reached out to his little brother, Lucas, who helped him design the application’s website from scratch.</p>
